## General requirements

Beginning with version 5.2.6, the module allows you to connect to printers using the following connection methods:

*   [QZ Print](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jzebra/) Java applet (According to information on the qz Customer Portal, support for the Legacy Applet Version (QZ Print) will be discontinued on January 1st, 2017);
*   [QZ Tray 2.x](https://qz.io/download/);
*   [PrintNode](https://app.printnode.com/account/download).

The requirements depend on the connection method you require:

*   For printing with the QZ Print Java applet, the module requires Java 5 or higher to be installed on your machine. For help installing Java on your platform, see the Java tutorial ([https://code.google.com/p/jzebra/wiki/TutorialJavaInstall](https://code.google.com/p/jzebra/wiki/TutorialJavaInstall)). Also, see [https://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml](https://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml) for help on enabling Java in your web browser. For more info on QZ Print, see {% link "Getting started with QZ Print Java applet" ref_1e1MaOuk %}.
*   For printing with QZ Tray 2.x, it is recommended to purchase QZ premium support at [http://buy.qz.io/](http://buy.qz.io/).  For more info, see {% link "Getting started with QZ Tray 2.x" ref_lh4nFlzm %}.
*   For printing with PrintNode, you need to register an account with PrintNode at [https://app.printnode.com/account/register](https://app.printnode.com/account/register). For more info, see {% link "Getting started with PrintNode" ref_L2vV8Twt %}.

## Hardware requirements

The minimum set of hardware required to be able to use the module includes a Barcode Scanner and a Receipt Printer. Such a set will be enough for stores that identify products using the barcodes printed by the manufacturer. If you are going to print your own barcodes, you will also need a Barcode Printer.

We guarantee that X-Cart's POS system module is compatible with the following hardware:

*   [Motorola LS2208-SR20007NA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-sr20007na.htm)

*   [Motorola LS2208-7AZU0100ZNA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-7azu0100zna.htm)

*   [Motorola LS2208-SR20007R-NA Barcode Scanner](http://www.barcodesinc.com/symbol/part-ls2208-sr20007r-na.htm)

*   [Citizen CT-S310II-U-BK Receipt Printer](http://www.barcodesinc.com/citizen/part-ct-s310ii-u-bk.htm)

*   [Zebra 282P-201110-000 Barcode Printer](http://www.barcodesinc.com/zebra/part-282p-201110-000.htm)

*   [Zebra 10010038 Barcode Label](http://www.barcodesinc.com/zebra/part-10010038.htm)

*   [BCIRPT3.125-STD Receipt Paper](http://www.barcodesinc.com/bci/part-rpt3.125-std.htm)

It's possible that other models can be used, but the ones listed above were tested and proved to be fully compatible. 

## Installation

The module POS system for X-Cart can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace. It is a commercial module, so you must purchase a license to be able to use it.

Note that the module POS system requires another module by X-Cart team to be installed and enabled - System fields. Be sure to enable this module prior to enabling the module POS system.
