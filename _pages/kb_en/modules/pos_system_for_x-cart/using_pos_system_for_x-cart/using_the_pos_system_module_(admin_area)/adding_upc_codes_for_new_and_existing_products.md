To create a barcode for a product, X-Cart's POS system module uses the value of the UPC ([Universal Product Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code)) field in the product's details.

This means that, before generating a barcode for any of the products in your store, you must add a UPC for this product. A UPC code for a product can be added via the product's editing page ("Info" tab):

If the product you are creating or editing does not have a barcode provided by the manufacturer, you will have to create your own UPC for it. To do so, type in the desired UPC code manually into the **UPC** box and save the product details. If the product already has a barcode that you want to use in your store, you can automate the process: simply place the cursor inside the **UPC** box and scan the product's barcode label with your Barcode scanner. The scanner will read the UPC code from the barcode, and it will appear in the **UPC** box. After this you will only need to save the product details.

UPC codes must be unique per product.

Once a UPC code is added for a product, a new tab titled "Barcode" appears on the product editing page:![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504429/7602274.png)
