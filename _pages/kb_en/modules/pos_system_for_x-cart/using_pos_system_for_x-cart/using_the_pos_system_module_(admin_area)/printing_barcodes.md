The POS system for X-Cart module allows you to print barcodes for each product in your store individually or for multiple products at once.

A prerequisite for printing barcodes is that the products for which you are going to print barcodes have been provided with UPC codes.

**To print a barcode for a single product**:

1.  In the Products section of your store's Admin area (**Catalog > Products**), find the product for which you need to print a barcode and open it for editing.
2.  Click on the "Barcode" tab to access the page where you can print the product's barcode and wait for the QZ Print applet to load:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504442/7602283.png)
3.  Use the **N items** input box to specify the number of barcode labels that needs to be printed and click the **Print barcode(s)** button. 

    The Barcode printer will print the specified number of labels.

**To mass-print barcodes for multiple products**:

1.  In the Products section of your store's Admin area (**Catalog > Products**), find the products for which you need to print barcodes and select them by putting tick marks in the check boxes opposite their names. 
2.  Click the **More actions** link below the list of products and select **Print barcodes** to access the page where you will be able to print barcodes for the products that have been selected:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504442/7602284.png)

    Once the QZ Print applet has loaded, you will see a page like following:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504442/7602285.png)

3.  Use the **N items** input box to specify the number of copies that need to be printed and click **Print barcodes(s)**.
    The Barcode printer will print the specified number of labels for each of the selected products.
