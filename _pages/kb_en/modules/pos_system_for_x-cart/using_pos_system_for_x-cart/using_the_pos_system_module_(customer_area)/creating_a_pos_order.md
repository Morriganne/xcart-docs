After the product has been added to cart, a new button - **Process order** - appears next to X-Cart's standard **Go to checkout** button:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/7504446/7602279.png)

By using this button the user can create the order at once - without having to provide information about the customers' address or payment method.

1.  A prerequisite for successfully creating an order via the **Process order** button is that the profile of the user acting as POS operator must be properly configured (i.e. it must contain information about the user's address and payment method).
2.  For orders created by users with the "POS operator" role, no shipping information is provided in the order details, since the goods are deemed to be sold at a POS location, without any shiping service involved.
