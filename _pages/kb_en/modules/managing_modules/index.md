The functionality of your X-Cart 5 based store can be extended by installing additional modules (add-ons). 

After installing X-Cart 5 you will find that your store already has some installed modules. You can view their list in the Installed Modules section (**Extensions** > **Installed modules**) in your store's Admin area. You can enable/disable specific modules according to your needs. See {% link "Activating and deactivating modules" ref_uEnDBBA7 %}.

It is possible to obtain and install more modules. A great selection of modules for X-Cart 5 is available via X-Cart's Marketplace; however, modules can also be obtained from other sources. To install a new module, please use the guidelines outlined in the following articles: 

*   {% link "Installing modules from the Marketplace" ref_Vn1mMUw9 %} (Use for modules obtained via X-Cart's Marketplace);
*   {% link "Uploading modules" ref_GZQ9vTq6 %} (Use for modules obtained elsewhere).
