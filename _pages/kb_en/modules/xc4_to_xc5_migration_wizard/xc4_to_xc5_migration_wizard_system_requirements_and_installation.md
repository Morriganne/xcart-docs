At the moment of writing this article, the module "XC4 to XC5 Migration wizard" is available for X-Cart versions 5.3.1 and later. It provides a tool for the migration of data and settings from X-Cart 4 based online stores (versions 4.4.0 or later) to the X-Cart 5 platform. For the most up-to-date information on the module compatibility, please see the [module page](https://market.x-cart.com/addons/migration-wizard.html).

To migrate your X-Cart 4 store to X-Cart 5, you need:

1.  Your existing X-Cart 4 store. For the migration, you will need to provide the migration module with your X-Cart 4 database connection details and your store URL, so be sure to have those at hand when you launch the Migration wizard.
2.  A fresh installation of X-Cart 5. **Important**: Be sure to use the default build configuration that you get right out of the distribution package. Do not install any additional modules and do not attempt any customizations of the X-Cart 5 store's default functionality or look & feel before your X-Cart 4 data and settings have been fully migrated. Be sure to remove any demo data that may be present in the X-Cart 5 store (A link to the "Remove data" tool will be provided at the first step of the Migration wizard).

The module can be obtained via X-Cart’s Marketplace:
