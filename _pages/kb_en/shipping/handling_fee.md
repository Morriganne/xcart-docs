If you have set up carrier-calculated or table-based shipping rates for your products, but want to increase the amount you charge customers for shipping a little bit to cover additional expenses like insurance or packing cost, you can do so by adding a _handling fee_. In X-Cart 5, handling fee is a fixed surcharge that is applied to orders shipped using a specific shipping method. The handling fee is added at checkout and is merged with your standard shipping rates, so the surcharge remains invisible to the buyers.

To set up a handling fee for some shipping method:

1.  In your store's Admin area, go to the Shipping methods section (**Store setup **>** Shipping**):
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306255/9437269.png)
2.  In the list of your store's shipping methods, find the method for which you want to add a surcharge.
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306255/9437270.png)
3.  Hover the mouse pointer over the line of this shipping method. The **Delivery time** and **Handling fee** fields will be highlighted as editable:
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306255/9437271.png)
4.  Click inside the **Handling fee** field and specify the surcharge amount you require.

5.  Click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the screen to save the changes.
    ![]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/9306255/9437274.png)
    The handling fee value will be updated.
